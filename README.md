# FunXBlog
- This is the repository for the website. 
- All posts are created with chatGPT APIs automatically, and would be renewed as the prompts creating them iterate to newer versions.
- The public homepage is 'https://funxblog.onrender.com/', but the intention of this website is to attract traffic from search engines for further monetization. So, for now, the home URL is mostly for developer purposes.
- Note: Because this website is still under testing/develop phase, it is on free hosting, hence loading speed now may not be desireable.
